# Engineering Projects With Arduino

### Day 1:  
* Introduction - Please - Check Their Pgm Skills  
* Introduction to Arduino  
* Introduction to Electronics - Breadboard, Resistor, LED  
* Introduction to good programming practice ( const int LED=pinno) (diff #define and const ?)  
* digitalWrite()
	* Blink LED  
	* LED Stoplight  
	* Pattern using LED(array (eg.pinArray[3]={3,4,5})  
* digitalRead()
	* Reading a switch  
	* Lighthing and LED using a switch  
	* Alternate LEDs using a switch  

### Day 2:  
* Analog vs digital  
* Why we need analog(real work all are analog but computers know only digital)  
* Introduction to POT and dim and brighten an LED  
* analogRead()
	* Reading a POT  
	* Turn on LED after some value  
	* LDR and do the same task on switching on an LED (Automating Street Light)  
* Introduction to Buzzer and its working  
* tone(), map()
	* Playing a definite note using a switch  
	* Light Thermin using LDR  
    
    
### Day 3:  
* Introduction to Sensors and Actuators  
* Introduction to IR Sensor  
* Detect Proximity of hand using LDR to turn on LED  
* Introduction to UltraSonic Sensor   
* Distance Measurement using Ultrasonic  
* Explain their use in Rover(To stop rover when it comes near a wall and constant distance measurement)  

### Day 4:   
* Introduction to PWM  
* analogWrite() - Dimming and brightning LED  		
* Introduction to DC motor and H-Bridge  
* Controlling the speed and direction of the DC motor  
* Function and Interrupts  


### Day 5:  
* I2C  
* Use of it in real-world
